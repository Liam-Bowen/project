The main component of the project is in Pycharm CE version 3. I used the newest version of flask to create a Flask application in the main function. The flask application imports Flask, render_template, session, redirect, url_for, request, jsonify, abort to help the code run. Within the pycharm project, create a static file that is going to be the shell for all html, js, css, and csv files. I stored the csv file in the static before exporting it into a MySQL session using the seed_db.py code. I used the sqlalchemy package to help build the table and import it to the session. The csv files that are accurate to be used are updated-batters.csv and updated-pitchers-csv. You need to have the MySQL workbench installed to use this. Follow the instructions on https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mysql-connections-new.html to create a sql workbench connection for the data to be imported to. Make sure to create a password you won't forget because you need to use that in your seed_py code when creating the engine variable.
